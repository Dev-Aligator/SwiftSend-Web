How much coding is enough?

I keep receiving queries as to how much of Data structures and Algorithms are needed.
The answer is, IT DEPENDS.
Bare minimum: You SHOULD be able to convert most of the REQUIREMENTS to CODE. (It doesn't have to be optimized)

This SHOULD be done before delving into frontend/backend/ML AI/Analytics.
Without basic logical abilities, you'll be screwed no matter what fancy tech you're using.

Frontend is not just dumping data to UI. You'll have to manipulate and transform it.

Even in backend, you have to heavily manipulate the data.

Just using scikit/numpy/pandas without basic coding abilities is not going to make you a data scientist.

Invest strong 4-6 months(minimum) to build your coding abilities.
How to know if we have done the bare minimum? These are the benchmarks:
1) Can solve 3-5 problems in codechef long challenge (Div-2)
2) 2 problems in codechef cook-off
3) 2 problems in codeforces rated
4) Easy problems on leetcode within 30 minutes without any help.

Without basic coding investment, you'll struggle the moment something slight complex comes up.

Note that these are bare minimum benchmarks. These are NOT enough for your interviews on DS/Algo for top product-based companies. I will talk about it in upcoming posts.

Hope this helps!
